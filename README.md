🧩 **The problem:**  

The travel agency have all kind of booking information across different database tables.

The agency needs structured data to create reports and track its KPIs.

1️⃣ Connect the on-premise database (PostgreSQL) to the cloud  
2️⃣ Copy the raw data into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 using Azure Data Factory  
3️⃣ Transform the data using Azure Databricks  
4️⃣ Optimize queries in Azure Synapse Analytics  
5️⃣ Use the processed/structured data to create personalized report in Power BI  

> [!NOTE]
> 💡 The process can be automated to run once every day which will guarantee that everyone will have accurate and up to date data.
